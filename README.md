# EXIF Estimation With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

## Digital forensics
### PhotoResponse NonUniformity (PRNU)
PRNU is a unique noise fingerprint left by camera sensors when taking photos. 
This fingerprint can be extracted and used to identify individual devices.

In 2016, Baroffio et al. trained a relatively simple convolutional network to discriminate photos
between 27 camera models:
